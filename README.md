# Project Description
Everyday billions of short texts are generated in an enormous volume in the form of search queries, news titles, tags, chat bots, social media posts etc. Understanding short texts retrieval, classification and processing become a very difficult task. Clustering short texts (such as news titles) by their meaning is a challenging task. The semantic hashing approach encodes the meaning of a text into a compact binary code. Thus, to tell if two texts have similar meanings, we only need to check if they have similar codes. The encoding is created by a deep neural network, which is trained on texts. To cluster short texts by their meanings, we propose to add more semantic signals to short texts. Specifically, for each term in a short text, we obtain its concepts and co-occurring terms from a database to enrich the short text. Furthermore, we introduce a simplified deep learning network for semantic hashing.

Many approaches have been proposed to facilitate short text understanding by enriching the short text. These approaches are based on semantic hashing models.

Our approach is based on semantic network for enriching a short text. We present a novel mechanism to semantically enrich short texts with both concepts and co-occurring terms.
